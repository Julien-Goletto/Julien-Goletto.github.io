#Welcome to Yves Signal's Book Frontend Projects

##Introduction
Hi there, I'm Julien, a fullstack developper apprentice, currently studying at O'clock 'til May 2022.
I welcome you to this modest project portfolio.
All these projects are made on my free time, so they do not contain any school intellectual materials.

For now on, I'm a lot onto [Front End Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/home) that provides me a lot of challenging prototypes to craft.
I cared a lot crafting all of theses without any framework, for learning sake, and even if they are a lot perfectible, I'm quite pride of where I am at today.
Once I finish a project, I move on, so the state of my early prototypes reflect the mindset I had then and possibly a lack of knowledge I learnt, becomming the best iteration of myself.

Enough talking, let's take a glimpse at what I produced !
